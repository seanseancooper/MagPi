ARX (ARXSignalPoint, ZeroMQ):
    ARXRecorder manufatcures ARXSignalPoint.
    ARXSignalPoint to output file.
    ARXSignalPoint ZeroMQ to ARXAudioEncoder
    project-keyword-spotter integration? feasible, alt. solution
    Elasticsearch mappings?
    Processing germane to audio:back to original requirements + new ideas.
    Local ML Models germane to audio.

BLU:
    NOT STARTED

CAM (FrameObjekt, RabbitMQ(events)?, ImageZMQ(images)):
    automate FrameObjektTracker output analysis: design a processing chain based on MQ.
    Choose Models; hugging face.
    Encoding frames using FrameObjektEncoder: what fields are encoded, and how analyzed.
    FrameObjekt ImageZMQ messaging: in progress.
    FrameObjektEncoder Elasticsearch mappings: on hold.

CAN:
    NOT STARTED: ideas

CONFIG:
    IDEA: Configuration layering, global vs.modile vs. class:
        class configuration: look for a configuration file at the same level as a class (overides class fields only), named 'class.json' where class is the name of the class.
        module configuration: look for a configuration for the module, in a dir called 'config'. This overides any 'class.json' class configuration if it exists.
        global configuration: look for a configuration file in 'config' directory, named 'module.json': this overides module config)
    poetential benefits vs. compleity added

EBS:
    configure text logging
    MCP Model Context Protocol client for my project.

GPS (MapAggregator, REST, class?):
    Trilaterator! Testdata and map symbology.
    implement GPS via JS: Delayed.
    GPS via hardware

LIB:
    code review: there is junk here and things to add.

MAP (MapAggregator, read configs, test REST endpoints and pull data [AGGREGATOR_TIMEOUT], class):
    Elastic Integration:
        Elastic pull()
    MapAggregator refresh; read from rabbitMQ, not REST
    hyperspectral imaging: BLOCKED DUE TO ENVIRONMENT

MOT:
    NEVER STARTED; may go away again.

NET:
    Directory structure for each, including ELK.
        ImageZMQ
        ZeroMQ
        RabbitMQ:
        ElasticSearch:
            data mapping. Dense vectors, nested data, types
            what about EAVs, object/NoSQL?
    Dashboard URL in template: too where/what?

PSX:
    NOT STARTED. Pyshark. Ideas? Visualizations? Stats? GPT?

SDR (SDRSignalPoint, RabbitMQ(vector, text), ZeroMQ(Signal)):
    Reciever modifications: assignable frequency, bandwidth

    A thing that looks at a block of spectrum, finds the peaks in the EM
    and tunes an SDRWorker() reciever to the peak frequency, recording it as a Signal().

    Enccapsulate an SDR signal in a Signal type.
    SignalPoint processing zeroMQ
    ARXAudioEncoder via MQ! not a local method. offline proccessing...
    Elasticsearch mappings

TRX (TRXSignalPoint, RabbitMQ (object), ZeroMQ(Signal)):
    TRXUSBRetriever docker solution: on hold.
    TRXSerialRetriever may be kaput on Mac? Verify this.
    TRXSignalPoint mappings

VIEW (ViewController, REST):
    Integrate Kibana: blocker is elastic https
    Integrate SDR: jupyterlite w/ matplotlib inline + custom javascript vertical waterfall served via node.

WIFI (WifiSignalPoint, RabbitMQ):
    Refactor Wifisscanner to read ALL SignalPoint types from MQ.
        Tabulator subsorting??

DOCKER:
    TRX:docker_trx: dockerfile and compose update: works, add spice where needed.
    NET:docker_elastic: dockerfile and compose updates: works, add spice where needed.
        HTTPS for Kibana:
            docker-compose.yaml for cluster appears to have certs and password is in env. It may be the case that it
            needs to be enabled and configured in the compose file.
        Kibana dashboards: component to read serialized json output on filesystem.

    NET:docker_rabbitMQ: dockerfile and compose updates: works, add spice where needed.

    node processes.
