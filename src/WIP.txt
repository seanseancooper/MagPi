config:
    IDEA: Configuration layering, global vs.modile vs. class:
        class configuration: look for a configuration file at the same level as a class (overides class fields only), named 'class.json' where class is the name of the class.
        module configuration: look for a configuration for the module, in a dir called 'config'. This overides any 'class.json' class configuration if it exists.
        global configuration: look for a configuration file in 'config' directory, named 'module.json': this overides module config)
    potential benefits vs. complexity added

SignalPoint Hierarchy [DESIGN IN PROGRESS]:
    2. Signal Typing & Labeling
    Label your signals by type:
        RADAR (pulse, FMCW, doppler): How do these signals appear as data? ndarray? vector?
        COMMS (voice, digital, burst)
        NAV (e.g., beacons, GPS)
        UNKNOWN: Deceptive/jamming patterns ( types don't support periodic data; Worker() will do this. )

        -- idea: label 'types' by signal: what frequencies is that thing putting out? what data type is this?

    Signal: Default text attributes, data of T (immutable) [UNKNOWN]

    SignalPoint: Base class (id, lat, lon, sgnl)
        ARXSignalPoint:  Continuous Recorded Audio Data, [COMMS]
        SDRSignalPoint:  Text attributes, Structured Array/Object data [NAV, COMMS]
            - ADVANCEDSignalPoint: (pulse, FM Carrier Wave, doppler) Ner signalPoint type for 'radar'.
        TRXSignalPoint:  Text attributes and ARXSignalPoint Data [COMMS]
        WifiSignalPoint: Continuous Vector Signal data [COMMS]

    FrameObjekt: CAM Image Container.

    1. Signal Sources as "Agents" [see notes in Worker];
    Each emitter can be modeled as an agent with:

        Location (lat, lon)
        Emission type (radar, voice, data)
        Repetition pattern (period, schedule, timing -- temporal data): Some types don't support periodic data
        Signal fingerprint (modulation, bandwidth, power, etc.)

    You could treat these like “classes” for supervised ML, or cluster them for unsupervised pattern discovery.

    Spectral Analysis Features to Extract for Each SignalPoint type [scipy.signal, numpy.fft]:
    Feature                         : Description

    Mean signal power               : Average strength
    Variance                        : Signal stability
    FFT Peak/Dominant Frequency     : Periodic behavior
    Auto-correlation lag            : Repetitions
    Coherence with other signals    : Time-dependent similarity
    Rolling correlation window      : Pairwise time-varying relationships [pandas.rolling().corr()]
    Mean signal power               : Average strength
