This requires 'hardware design' cycle; I've done this before with the 'SDR Radio'
I build in 2020, I know this is feasible. The question is (and always is...)
much amperage this hardware will draw...

What is the RTL-SDR frequency range?

This is dependent on the particular tuner variant used in the dongle, and the particular
implementation. Some dongles, like our RTL-SDR Blog V3 and V4 also have hardware
enhancements that enable reception below 24 MHz.

Tuner 	                    Frequency range
Elonics E4000 	            52 – 2200 MHz with a gap from 1100 MHz to 1250 MHz (varies)
Rafael Micro R820T/2/R860 	24 – 1766 MHz (Can be improved to ~13 - 1864 MHz with experimental drivers)
Rafael Micro R828D
RTL-SDR Blog V4 Model:      24 - 1766 MHz. Other models may have a cutoff around 1 GHz.
Fitipower FC0013 	        22 – 1100 MHz
Fitipower FC0012 	        22 – 948.6 MHz
FCI FC2580 	                146 – 308 MHz and 438 – 924 MHz (gap in between)

As you can see from the table, the Elonics E4000 and Rafael Micro R820T/2/R860 and R828D
dongles have the greatest frequency range.

Would it be possible to access the Wifi native hardware?

Frequency Analysis Chain:
    WIFI --*--> SDR |----> FFT
                    |----> HIST
                    |----> MFCC
                    |----> FREQ

    * = provide frequency to SDR
