keyword-spotter integration via remote model --> MCP

3. Pattern Learning
Use statistical or ML models to find structure:
    Clustering: Find recurring emission types or behaviors (DBSCAN, k-means)
    Classification: Identify known emitters or mission profiles
    Sequence modeling: Use HMMs or LSTMs to learn time-based sequences of events
    Anomaly detection: Spot rare or covert behavior

4. Prediction & Inference
Once models learn normal behavior:
    Predict next signal in a sequence
    Infer emitter identity or intent
    Detect prep for operations or movement
    Spot spoofing or jamming attempts

    # 2. Temporal Event Sequences
    # Use time-series to model:
    #     Emission patterns
    #     Inter-event intervals (e.g., radar → data uplink → artillery)

    # 3. Probabilistic Inference Engine
    # Apply:
    #     Markov Chains or Bayesian Networks to model expected vs. unexpected sequences
    #     Anomaly detection for spotting new patterns (e.g., movement prep)
